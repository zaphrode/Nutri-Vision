# 2006-SCMA-SEITRAMS Nutri-Vision
## About 
This is a project for NTU SC2006 Software Engineering Module. Our task was to create innovative applications that exploit publicly available goverment data to change the ways we live, learn and work. All teams were required to use government APIs and/or other publicly available data APIs for real word data.

We have developed a mobile application that enables users to keep track of their food intake and make healthier food choices. The best part is, Nutri-Vision automatically identifies food ingredients based on images captured or uploaded and auto-calculates the corresponding macro-nutrients, making it more user-friendly and convenient. 

## Goals
Our project was inspired by the well known mobile application MyFitnessPal. However, we wanted to enhance the user convenience by allowing users take pictures of their food and directly receive the macronutrients from it, rather than having to individually key in each ingredient/food item in their meals. Hence, we used OpenAI API to recognise the food images, and subsequently sent the image into Calorie Ninja API to retrieve the macronutrient values for display to the user. This was also a unique feature of our application. Even though this application was made for the purpose of a school module, we hope to see further incorporations of Artificial Intelligence into more mobile applications on the market in the future. 

## Learning Journey
With many of us having little to no knowledge in app development. There was indeed a steep learning curve ahead of us when we first embarked on the mod. On top of having to learn new technology, programming languages, frameworks, we also had to do our best to align our project milestones and deliverables with content from the lectures. And do our best to employ the knoweldge learnt in the lectures (Requirements Elicitation, Requirements Analysis, Dynamic Models, System Design, Object Design, Test fundamentals, Black and White box testing etc.)

## Personal Contributions
I was responsible for creating several UI pages, including ScannerPage, NutritionalInfoPage, ConfirmMealPage, and ProfilePage. Additionally, I assisted my peers with backend tasks to ensure data was displayed correctly. I undertook the challenge of learning JavaScript and React Native while also mastering API calls in a limited timeframe. Furthermore, I acquired skills in reading, writing, and updating records in the Firestore Database.

## TechStack
- React Native as framework to build the UI
- Firebase as both back-end and database
- OpenAI API
- CalorieNinja API

## Skillsets employed
- SOLID design principles
- Observer & Strategy Pattern
- Software Process: Waterfall model & Incremental Development

## Languages used
- Javascript
- JSX (Javascript XML)
